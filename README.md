üöÄ Features
-----------

*   **Blazing Fast:** A lean C-based VM with minimal overhead allows for execution speeds that challenge optimized scripts from established languages.
    
*   **Extremely Lightweight:** Tiny memory footprint makes it ideal for environments where resource usage is critical.
    
*   **Simple, C-style Syntax:** Easy to learn for anyone familiar with C, Java, or JavaScript.
    
*   **Compiler + VM Architecture:** AbyssLang code is compiled into a compact bytecode format, which is then executed by the optimized virtual machine.
    

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
--------------

*   **Core Language:** C
    
*   **Build System:** Make (Makefile)
    
*   **Benchmarking & Tooling:** Shell Script (benchmark.sh), Python
    

‚öôÔ∏è Installation

---------------

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AbrorPatidinov/ProjectAbyss.git
    cd ProjectAbyss
    ```

2.  **Compile the binaries:**
    The easiest way is to use the provided `Makefile`:
    ```sh
    make
    ```
    Alternatively, you can compile the files manually:
    ```sh
    # Compile the AbyssLang Compiler
    gcc -std=c11 -O2 -o abyssc abyssc.c
    
    # Compile the Virtual Machine
    gcc -std=c11 -O2 -o abyss_vm vm.c
    ```
    

üèÉ Run Locally
--------------

Running an AbyssLang program is a two-step process: **compile** and **execute**.

1.  **Compile your `.al` file into bytecode (`.aby`):**
    ```sh
    ./abyssc sample.al sample.aby
    ```

2.  **Execute the bytecode with the VM:**
    ```sh
    ./abyss_vm sample.aby
    ```
    

Usage/Examples
--------------

Here is the sample program used in the original benchmark, demonstrating the simple syntax of AbyssLang.

```al
// File: sample.al

// A simple program to loop N times and print a value.
print_show("AbyssLang benchmark start\n");

i = 0;
N = 200000;

while (i < N) {
  print(42);
  i = i + 1;
}

print_show("AbyssLang benchmark end\n");  

```

That's it. This will create a clean, properly highlighted code block just like it's supposed to be. No more alphabet soup of languages.


üìò AbyssLang Documentation (v0.1)
---------------------------------

#### Overview

AbyssLang is a lightweight, experimental programming language written in C. It is designed to be simple, fast, and closer to the machine, while offering higher-level abstractions than raw C.

The primary goals are:

*   Minimal syntax.
    
*   Easy to parse.
    
*   Efficient bytecode execution via a custom VM.
    
*   Faster execution than Python for equivalent tasks.

### üöÄ VS Code Extension

Of course, a high-performance language deserves a great editing experience. To make your life easier, there's an official AbyssLang extension for VS Code that gives you syntax highlighting and snippets.

Since this is all about keeping things simple, you can install it directly without needing the Marketplace.

1.  **Download the Extension**Go to the [**GitHub Releases**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https://github.com/AbrorPatidinov/ProjectAbyss/releases/) page and download the latest .vsix file.
    
2.  **Install in VS Code**
    
    *   Open VS Code.
        
    *   Go to the **Extensions** view on the left sidebar.
        
    *   Click the three dots (...) at the top of the Extensions panel.
        
    *   Select **"Install from VSIX..."** and choose the .vsix file you just downloaded.
        
3.  **Enjoy!**Your .al files will now have full syntax highlighting.

‚ùì FAQ
-----

*   **Is it really faster than Python?**
    
    *   Yes. In our benchmark, AbyssLang was ~33% faster and used 80% less memory than an equivalent, highly-optimized Python script. This is due to a much leaner VM and object model.
        
*   **Is this language production-ready?**
    
    *   Not yet. AbyssLang is a proof-of-concept and is still in the early stages of development.
        

lessons-learned Lessons Learned
-------------------------------

*   **Performance vs. Features:** Every high-level feature (like dynamic typing or garbage collection) introduces a performance trade-off. Building from scratch highlights how significant this overhead can be.
    
*   **The Power of C:** For performance-critical applications like building a language VM, C provides the necessary control over memory and execution.
